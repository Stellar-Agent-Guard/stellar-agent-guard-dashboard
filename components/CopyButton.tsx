/**
 * One-click copy for the addresses and hashes operators handle by hand (issue #33).
 *
 * Manual select-triple-click-copy fails in the worst way: a partial address or a
 * half-hash pastes into an explorer and comes back as "not found", which reads as
 * a chain problem rather than a copy problem. The button writes the *full* value
 * through the async Clipboard API and shows the result:
 *
 *   - success: the button swaps to "Copied ✓" for a moment, then reverts;
 *   - failure: an inline "select manually" hint renders and the value itself
 *     stays selectable on screen.
 *
 * Secure context: the async Clipboard API exists only in a secure context
 * (HTTPS / localhost exemptions) with write permission granted. Development over
 * plain `http://` from a LAN address, or a permission denial, makes the write
 * reject — the failure path below renders the hint and announces "Copy failed"
 * rather than failing silently, so the operator always knows the clipboard does
 * not hold the value and can select it the old way.
 *
 * Announcements go through the shared `announce()` channel. Copies are
 * user-initiated actions, so their result is announced under the same
 * user-action-result category the announcer already applies to transaction
 * milestones (polite, deduplicated by its duplicate window) — this is distinct
 * from poll-driven state changes, which the announcer deliberately suppresses.
 * Failure is announced with the same parity as success; a silent failure is the
 * one outcome the issue rules out.
 *
 * Focus: the component is a real `<button>` (keyboard-operable by default) and
 * never moves focus — after a click the button stays the active element, so a
 * keyboard operator can press Enter again to re-copy without re-tabbing.
