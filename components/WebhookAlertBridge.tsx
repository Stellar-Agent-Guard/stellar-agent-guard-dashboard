/**
 * Watches the guard's live state and dispatches webhooks when a configured
 * threshold is crossed (issue #141).
 *
 * This is the whole of the alerting logic's caller: it holds no policy of its
 * own, reads the conditions the console already reads, and hands them to
 * `webhookDispatcher`, which decides whether an event is due. Keeping the
 * decision in the pure module is what lets the tests cover "a frozen guard paged
 * once, not once per poll" without a browser.
 *
 * It renders nothing. A dispatch failure is reported through the toast-free
 * `announce` channel rather than a banner, because a console that cannot reach
 * the webhook must not also cover the panel the operator is trying to work in —
 * the settings dialog's "Test webhook" is where a delivery problem is
 * diagnosed.
