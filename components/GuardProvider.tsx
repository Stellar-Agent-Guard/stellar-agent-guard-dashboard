/**
 * The console's client-side state: the wallet, the selected guard, a polled
 * snapshot of that guard, and the event feed.
 *
 * Two rules shape this provider, and both come from the same commitment — the
 * interface must never show a number it did not read from the chain:
 *
 *   1. A failed read is stored as an error, never as a default. `snapshot` keeps
 *      each field's own success/failure, and the panels render the failure.
 *   2. The feed is fed from two clearly-labelled sources. Ledger events are
 *      settled history; diagnostic events come from a refused write this console
 *      performed, and are labelled as such, because a rolled-back event is
 *      evidence of a refusal rather than of state.
