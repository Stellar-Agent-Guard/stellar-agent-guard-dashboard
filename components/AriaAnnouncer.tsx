/**
 * The live regions that actually speak.
 *
 * Two regions are rendered up front and never replaced: one `polite` for
 * routine lifecycle updates, one `assertive` for critical alerts. Swapping a
 * region's node would detach it from the accessibility tree and silence it,
 * so the regions are static and only their text content changes.
 *
 * The queue is drained one message at a time with a short gap, and the region
 * is cleared before each message is written. The clear/write pair happens in
 * two ticks on purpose: setting the same text twice in one tick produces no
 * DOM mutation a screen reader would notice, which would silently drop a
 * legitimate repeat announcement (e.g. two confirmations on the same ledger).
