 * the contract itself reports, and it refuses to claim success if the flag did
 * not actually change — a write that was signed and included but did not take
 * effect must not be reported as a freeze.
 *
 * That same reasoning decides what is spoken (issue #30). A screen-reader
 * operator cannot see the badge flip or the notice appear, so the verified
 * outcome is announced: the confirmation, or the failure *with its reason*,
 * which is the part that says whether the account is frozen right now. The write
 * path already announces the transaction itself; this is the announcement about
 * the effect. It leaves through the shell's live region by way of `announce()`,
 * so it survives the dialog being torn down by the very interaction that
