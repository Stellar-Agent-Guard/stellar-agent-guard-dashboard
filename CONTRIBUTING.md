# Contributing

`stellar-agent-guard-dashboard` is the operator console: a pure client-side Next.js app
that holds no keys and runs no server code, so most changes are UI, client-side Soroban
RPC, or tests.

## Shared conventions

Commit style, the one-commit-per-logical-unit **per file** rule, the branch lifecycle
(feature branch → PR → delete after merge, `main` only), and the issue label taxonomy are
defined once for this org in the
[`stellar-agent-guard-sdk` CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Read that first; this page only adds what is specific to the dashboard.

## Local gates before pushing

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # eslint
npm test            # node --test (unit suite)
npm run test:docs   # internal Markdown references resolve
npm run build       # Next.js production build
```

Two extra scripts are not part of the CI gate:

- `npm run prove:phase3` — re-runs the live testnet proof against the real deployed
  contract; needs funded testnet keypairs.
- `npm run inspect` — read-only dump of a deployed instance's on-chain state.

Two more are tooling rather than gates, both described below:

- `npm run format` — rewrite the repository with Prettier.
- `npm run changelog` — regenerate `CHANGELOG.md` from conventional commits.

## Pre-commit hook

Husky installs a `pre-commit` hook on `npm install` (`prepare` in `package.json`), and
lint-staged runs it over **staged** files only — see `.husky/pre-commit`,
`.lintstagedrc.json` and `.prettierrc.json`:

| Staged files    | What runs                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `*.ts`, `*.tsx` | `eslint --fix`, then `prettier --check` |
| `*.json`        | `prettier --check`                      |

`eslint --fix` repairs what it can and fails the commit on what it cannot. Prettier only
_checks_, so a formatting problem stops the commit with Prettier's own message instead of
being silently rewritten — run `npm run format` (or `npx prettier --write <file>`) and
commit again. `HUSKY=0 git commit …` bypasses the hook for a one-off emergency commit;
CI never runs it, because CI never commits.

Prettier is configured at `printWidth: 120`, matching the hand-written style already in
the repository, so the first format of a file should be close to a no-op. `package-lock.json`
and `tests/fixtures/phase3-proof.json` are generated and ignored (`.prettierignore`).

## Documentation links

`npm run test:docs` runs `scripts/check-doc-links.mjs`, which walks every `.md`/`.mdx`
file, extracts inline links, images, HTML `href`/`src` attributes and reference-style
definitions, and fails on a relative path that does not exist or a `#fragment` that is not
a heading in its target. It never makes a network request, so external URLs are skipped;
fenced code blocks, inline code spans and HTML comments are not scanned, which is why the
syntax can be documented without documenting itself. Anchor matching implements GitHub's
heading → anchor rules, including the double hyphen an em dash leaves behind.

CI runs it, so a broken cross-reference — a renamed heading, a moved file — fails the
build rather than quietly misleading a reader.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is generated, not hand-edited:

```bash
npm run changelog                                  # rewrite CHANGELOG.md
node scripts/generate-changelog.mjs --stdout       # preview it
node scripts/generate-changelog.mjs --version 0.2.0 --date 2026-09-25
```

`scripts/generate-changelog.mjs` reads the commits since the last release tag (or the
whole history when nothing has been tagged), groups them into Features, Bug Fixes,
Documentation and Maintenance, links `#123` references to the issue, and renders
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) Markdown. A commit only appears
if it declares a type, so merging a PR with a proper commit subject is what puts it in the
changelog; commits that do not parse are counted and reported, never silently rendered as
something they are not. `tests/unit/changelog.test.ts` covers the parsing and rendering.

## Local sandbox

For offline development — no public testnet, no browser wallet required for reads —
`scripts/start-local-sandbox.sh` boots a local standalone Stellar/Soroban network in
Docker, deploys the pinned guard artifact to it, and points the console at it:

```bash
npm run sandbox        # first run pulls the stellar/quickstart image
npm run dev            # restart the dev server if it was already running
# open http://localhost:3000

npm run sandbox -- --down   # stop the network and remove the container
```

Requirements: Docker (with a reachable daemon) and Node 24+. The script, in order:

1. checks that Docker is installed and that its daemon answers;
2. starts an ephemeral `stellar/quickstart` container publishing port 8000, with
   `--local --enable core,horizon,rpc` (override with `SAG_SANDBOX_FLAGS`);
3. waits for the RPC to answer, probing both `/soroban/rpc` and `/rpc` — the RPC path
   moved between quickstart image generations and whichever responds is the one recorded;
4. runs `scripts/deploy-local.ts`, which fetches the pinned artifact's bytes from public
   testnet, checks they hash to the pin (`f47919…`, 39673 bytes), uploads those exact
   bytes to the local network, creates the guard at the address predicted from a fixed
   salt _before_ signing, and re-reads the instance to confirm it runs them;
5. funds a throwaway local admin keypair and agent keypair from the local friendbot and
   calls `initialize(admin, agent)`;
6. writes `.env.local` and prints the addresses.

`.env.local` (gitignored) is what moves the console:

| Variable                                           | Effect                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`                              | the RPC endpoint the console reads and broadcasts to        |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`                   | the passphrase transactions and auth entries are signed for |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME`                         | the network name shown in the wallet-mismatch message       |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARTIFACT_SOURCE_CONTRACT_ID`          | the instance the pinned bytes are read from                 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GUARD_CONTRACT_ID`                    | the guard the selector opens on                             |
| `SAG_LOCAL_ADMIN_SECRET`, `SAG_LOCAL_AGENT_SECRET` | the throwaway local keypairs                                |

`lib/guard/network.ts` and `lib/guard/instance.ts` read these with public testnet as the
default, so an ordinary build is unchanged. What they cannot change is the artifact pin:
the hash and byte length are constants, and the deploy flow refuses any bytecode that does
not match them, whichever instance it was read from. These are public endpoints (plus two
local-only test secrets) and are never required in CI or in a deployment.

Caveats worth knowing, since the rest of this repository is explicit about proof:

- the container is ephemeral, so stopping it discards the local ledger; re-running the
  script redeploys the _same_ guard address, because the salt is fixed;
- the local friendbot and accounts are throwaway. Never reuse those keys, and never fund
  them on another network;
- write actions still need Freighter, pointed at the local network. Reads, telemetry and
  the deploy script itself work without any wallet.

## Branch protection and CI

`main` is protected by the `main-protection` ruleset, and the required status check is
named exactly **`ci`**. The `ci` workflow runs typecheck, lint, the unit tests, the
documentation link check, the production build, and a dedicated step that re-checks the
enforcement-scope statement in `README.md` and `SPEC.md` against the canonical constant in
`lib/guard/network.ts` (`tests/unit/scopeStatement.test.ts`). Rewording the boundary fails
CI, which is the point — see [Enforcement scope](README.md#enforcement-scope--read-this-before-relying-on-the-caps).
