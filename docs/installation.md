# Installation & Running

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `v24.0.0` or higher
- **Browser Extension**: [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) configured for **Testnet**

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-dashboard.git
cd stellar-agent-guard-dashboard
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Connect Freighter to interact with testnet instances.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # unit tests (57 passing tests)
npm run test:docs    # internal Markdown references resolve
npm run build        # production build
npm run inspect      # inspect deployed instance
```

## Offline Development (local sandbox)

To work without public testnet nodes, `npm run sandbox` starts a local standalone Soroban
network in Docker, deploys the pinned guard artifact to it, and writes `.env.local` so the
console reads and broadcasts against it. Stop it again with
`npm run sandbox -- --down`. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-dashboard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full startup sequence, the environment variables it writes, and its caveats.
