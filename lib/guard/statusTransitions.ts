/**
 * Polls refresh silently: the numbers on the panel change and nothing says so.
 * For a sighted operator the change is visible; for a screen-reader operator it
 * is not, which is why a 15s poll of an account that has just been frozen by
 * something else can pass completely unheard.
 *
 * The rule this module enforces is the one that makes announcements usable at
 * all: **transitions only**. A poll that re-reads the same state announces
 * nothing, no matter how often it runs. Only a flip of a flag the operator acts
 * on — the admin freeze, the dead-man switch, whether a policy is installed — is
 * news. Announcing every poll would make the live region a firehose that
 * interrupts whatever the operator was actually reading.
 *
 * The comparison is pure and takes a plain flags object rather than a snapshot,
 * so the transition table is testable without a chain, and the "did anything
 * change?" question is answered by construction rather than by remembering what
 * was said. Like every announcement in this console, the messages leave through
 * `announce()`.
