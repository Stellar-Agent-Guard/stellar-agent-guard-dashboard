/**
 * Per-guard feed subscriptions — the multi-guard live tail.
 *
 * Issue #23's scope decision was option (a): one merged feed, with a
 * guard-attribution chip on every row. The SDK's telemetry listener is a
 * single-guard reader (`GuardTelemetryListener` filters server-side by contract
 * id), so tailing N guards means N listener instances and therefore N poll
 * loops. This module owns that fan-out, and the two things that make it safe:
 *
 *   1. **A hard cap.** Poll load scales linearly with the number of monitored
 *      guards, so the supervisor only ever runs `cap` listeners. Guards past the
 *      cap are reported (never silently dropped) so the UI can say plainly how
 *      many are not being tailed. See the README's poll-load clause.
 *   2. **Reconciliation, not accumulation.** `sync()` is the single mutation
 *      point: it diffs the desired registry against the running listeners,
 *      stops and removes the ones that are gone, and starts the ones that are
 *      new. Repeated registry mutations therefore leave exactly
 *      `current-registry-size` listeners behind — there is no growth path.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the chain by itself: it is handed a factory, so the same
 * class is exercised by the browser (real `GuardFeed` instances) and by the
 * unit tests (deterministic mock streams) without a network.
 */

/**
 * The displayed cap on simultaneously tailed guards.

 * Chosen as a small, honest number rather than an unbounded fan-out: each guard
 * is one more `getEvents` poll loop, so the cap is the point at which the

 * of quietly multiplying RPC load. The README documents that trade-off.
