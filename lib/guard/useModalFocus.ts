/**
 * Focus management for a modal dialog, in one place.
 *
 * A modal has to do four things or it is broken in one of two directions: move
 * focus into itself on open, keep Tab cycling inside it, close on Escape, and
 * give focus back to the control that opened it. Skip the first and focus stays
 * behind the dialog on a page the operator cannot see; skip the last and focus
 * lands nowhere on dismissal. Both fail WCAG 2.1 AA keyboard requirements, and
 * both are invisible to a mouse-driven test.
 *
 * It lives here, rather than inline in the panel that uses it, for two reasons
 * the freeze dialog is the proof of: the trap and the announcement of a result
 * have to coexist, and "the result is announced before the dialog is torn down"
 * is only assertable if the teardown is a unit something else can observe.
 *
 * The focus restore happens in the effect's cleanup rather than in the close
 * handler, so *every* way out of the dialog — Escape, Cancel, or proceeding to
 * sign — returns focus exactly once, and the restore is ordered after whatever
 * the close itself announced.
