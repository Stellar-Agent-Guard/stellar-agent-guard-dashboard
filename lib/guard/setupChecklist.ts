/**
 * The post-deploy checklist, derived from the chain rather than remembered.
 *
 * The wizard's whole design constraint is that a step's state is a *function of
 * live reads* — `deployedMarker`, `isInitialized()`, `status()` and `policy()` —
 * so there is no stored "step 3 complete" boolean that can outlive the truth it
 * claims. A wizard that lies about having completed is worse than no wizard,
 * because it turns "I think this is configured" into an operator's false
 * confidence.
 *
 * The one thing that *is* stored is the operator's own interface state, and it is
 * deliberately exactly two keys:
 *
 *   - `dismissed` — hide the checklist (see the non-concealment invariant: the
 *     `StatusPanel`'s default-deny warning is derived from `status()`, so
 *     dismissing this wizard cannot hide it);
 *   - `deployedMarker` — the address predicted at deploy time, which is the only
 *     fact about a deploy the chain cannot re-derive for a browser that has not
 *     adopted the instance yet.
 *
 * `SETUP_STORED_KEYS` is asserted in tests against the raw persisted JSON, so a
 * future edit that starts persisting a completion bit fails the audit rather
 * than shipping.
