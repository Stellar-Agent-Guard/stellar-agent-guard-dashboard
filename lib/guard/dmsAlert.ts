/**
 * Dead-man-switch expiration alerting.
 *
 * The switch itself lives on-chain: `status()` reports `last_heartbeat` and the
 * ledger's `now`, `policy()` reports `dms_grace_secs`, and the account refuses
 * agent activity once `last_heartbeat + dms_grace_secs` is behind the ledger
 * clock. This module is the dashboard's *proactive* layer over those three
 * numbers — it classifies how close the console is to that deadline so the UI
 * can escalate before the switch trips, rather than only reporting it after.
 *
 * Every calculation here reads the **ledger clock** (`status.now`), never
 * `Date.now()`. The switch is judged by ledger time on chain, so an operator's
 * skewed local clock must not be able to green-wash a late heartbeat or
 * cry-wolf an early one. The calendar estimate is the one wall-clock
 * translation, and it is labelled an estimate because ledger close time tracks
 * wall clock only approximately.
 *
 * Thresholds (from the alerting spec):
 * - `warning` (yellow) when less than 25% of the grace remains, or less than
 *   one hour of absolute time remains — the acceptance criterion's "under 1
 *   hour or 20%" bar is fully covered, since 20% < 25%.
 * - `critical` (red, pulsing) when less than 10% of the grace remains.
 * - `expired` (dark red) once the deadline is reached or `status()` reports
 *   `heartbeat_expired`.
 *
 * The remaining-time formula mirrors the SDK's `deadManRemaining` exactly
 * (`last_heartbeat + dms_grace_secs - now`); it is recomputed here rather than
 * delegated because the alert layer needs the whole timeline — remaining,
 * elapsed, fraction, calendar expiry — from the same three fields in one pass.
