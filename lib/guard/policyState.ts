/**
 * Which of the three policy states a guard is in, derived from one live read.
 *
 * There are three states, not two, and the third one is the point of this module:
 * `unknown` is what an unreadable `status()` looks like, and it is not the same
 * as `default-deny`. Reading `no policy` off a failed read is how a dashboard
 * ends up claiming a safe state it never read, which SPEC §4's "no
 * default-on-failure" rule forbids.
 *
 * Nothing here caches: the answer is a pure function of the `ReadResult` the
 * snapshot carries, so it changes the moment a re-read returns a different
 * value. A revoke performed in another tab, or by the operator's own agent, is
 * therefore reflected by the next poll with no local flag to keep in step — the
 * same derived-from-truth discipline the configurator's "Load installed" draft
 * follows.
