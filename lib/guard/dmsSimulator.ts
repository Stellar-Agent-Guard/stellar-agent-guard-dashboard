/**
 * Incident Simulation Mode: what the dead-man switch looks like when it fires,
 * without waiting for the real timer and without touching the chain.
 *
 * Operators train new team members and rehearse alert escalation against a
 * live-looking console. Rehearsal needs the *shape* of an incident — the grace
 * countdown draining, the switch tripping, the freeze — but rehearsal must
 * never be an incident: every value here is computed locally, nothing in this
 * module performs a read or a write, and the state is fenced behind an
 * explicit opt-in so it cannot silently blend into production reads.
 *
 * The module is a pure function of its inputs. `tick` is injectable so tests
 * pin the clock and step through state transitions deterministically; the UI
 * drives it with the wall clock. Like the rest of `lib/guard`, it is
 * isomorphic and carries no React, no RPC, and no `Buffer`.
