/**
 * The custom webhook dispatcher (issue #141).
 *
 * An operator whose incident process lives in Slack, PagerDuty or a SIEM needs
 * the guard to speak to it. Everything else in this console keeps its alerts
 * inside the tab that raised them — a chime, a banner, a row in the feed — so a
 * freeze that happens while nobody has the console open is a freeze nobody
 * hears about. This module dispatches those same events outward as a signed
 * HTTP POST.
 *
 * Five decisions shape it:
 *
 *   - **Client-side, like everything else here.** The POST goes from the
 *     operator's browser straight to the webhook URL. There is no server
 *     component that could hold the signing secret, and no relay that could
 *     quietly widen what is sent.
 *   - **Signed, and signing is opt-in.** When a secret is configured the body
 *     carries an HMAC-SHA256 over `<timestamp>.<body>` in a header, which is
 *     what lets the receiver prove the payload came from this console and was
 *     not replayed. With no secret the payload still sends — an operator
 *     pointing at an internal SIEM does not always get to choose a shared
 *     secret — and the headers say plainly that it is unsigned rather than
 *     implying a signature that is not there.
 *   - **Edge-triggered, then rate-limited.** A frozen guard stays frozen, and
 *     the console polls every few seconds; a level-triggered dispatcher would
 *     fire the same alert forever. Each event fires on the transition into its
 *     condition, and a per-event cooldown then bounds repeats even when a
 *     condition genuinely flaps.
 *   - **A failed dispatch is reported, never retried silently.** Retrying a
 *     webhook without backoff is how an alert endpoint gets taken down by the
 *     alert system. The rate limit is the ceiling; the operator decides whether
 *     to send again.
 *   - **The alert vocabulary lives here, not in the component.** Deciding that
 *     a freeze, a dead-man-switch countdown and a burst of refusals are worth
 *     waking somebody for is the security-relevant part, so it is a pure
 *     function with unit tests rather than an inline `if` in JSX — the same
 *     split `audioAlert.ts` uses.

 *   - `DMS_EXPIRING` — the heartbeat deadline is approaching. This is the only
 *     one of the three that is *preventive*: it exists so the freeze it
 *     precedes never happens.
