/**
 * The words the console speaks when an operator's own action finishes.
 *
 * Every string a screen reader hears for a *result* lives here, is spoken through
 * `announce()` — the single write chokepoint into the shell's live regions — and
 * is therefore greppable in one file. Keeping the copy out of the components is
 * what makes it an inventory: a translation pass (the i18n follow-up to #30) has
 * one module to walk instead of hunting through event handlers, and the tests can
 * assert that each template is still wired to the handler that owns the event.
 *
 * Two choices are fixed here rather than at the call sites, and both are
 * incident-detection choices:
 *
 *   1. A failure is announced assertively and always carries its reason. "Freeze
 *      failed" on its own tells a screen-reader operator only that something
 *      broke, which is strictly less than the reason the sighted operator reads
 *      on screen; the reason is the part that says what to do next.
 *   2. A success is announced only once the chain re-read confirms the effect.
 *      The write path already announces "transaction confirmed"; this is the
 *      announcement that the *effect* the operator asked for is on chain, which
 *      is the only claim the console is allowed to make (see `PanicPanel`).
