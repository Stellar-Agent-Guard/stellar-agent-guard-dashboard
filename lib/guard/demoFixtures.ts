/**
 * Demo fixtures: a self-contained, zero-config way to start the console with
 * realistic data and no wallet, no contracts, and no RPC.
 *
 * This module exists to make the dashboard legible to someone who has five
 * minutes and no funded testnet keypair. It is deliberately the *only* place in
 * the project that fabricates guard state, and it is fenced off by an explicit
 * opt-in so it can never be confused with the real thing:
 *
 *   - it activates only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` (see `npm run dev:demo`)
 *     or when the URL carries `?demo=true`;
 *   - while active, the interface renders a top-level badge naming the data as
 *     static fixture data, and writes are disabled;
 *   - when it is not active, nothing here is reached, so the console's "no mock
 *     state" guarantee — every number read from the chain, every failed read
 *     rendered as a failure — is untouched.
 *
 * The fixtures are shaped against the SDK's own `GuardStatus` / `PolicyConfig`
 * types and the confirmed event vocabulary (`GUARD_EVENT_TOPICS`), so demo data
 * cannot drift into a shape the real console would never produce.
 *
 * Note the explicit field-by-shape construction rather than classes: like the
 * rest of `lib/guard`, this module is loaded by `node --test` through Node's
 * type-stripping loader, which rejects constructs that need a build step.
