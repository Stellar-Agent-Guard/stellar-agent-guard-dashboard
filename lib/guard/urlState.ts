/**
 * The console's shareable-view URL state (issue #132).
 *
 * An operator debugging an incident with a teammate needs to hand over exactly
 * what they are looking at: this guard, on this network, this tab, this filter.
 * This module is the single codec for those four query parameters —
 *
 *   `/?guard=CA3D…&network=testnet&tab=telemetry&filter=blocked`
 *
 * — and it is deliberately split into pure functions over search strings
 * (`encode` / `decode` / `merge`) plus one thin browser binding
 * (`writeUrlState`). Three rules shape it, and all three come from the console's
 * existing commitments:
 *
 *   1. **Everything a link carries is untrusted input.** Each parameter is
 *      validated against its own vocabulary — a guard address must look like a
 *      contract address, the tab/filter/network must be values this build
 *      actually has — and anything that fails is *dropped*, never adopted. A
 *      malformed parameter can therefore never reach state, and the next write
 *      removes it from the address bar (see `mergeUrlState`).
 *   2. **Writing the URL is never navigation.** State is mirrored with
 *      `history.replaceState`: no reload, no history spam, no lost feed,
 *      wallet session or form draft. Unknown parameters (`?demo=true`, UTM
 *      noise, a hand-edited `?section=`) pass through untouched — this module
 *      owns four keys and only ever rewrites those four.
 *   3. **Defaults are omitted.** A URL is shareable exactly as it appears: the
 *      verdict filter is dropped while it is `all`, so a quiet view stays a
 *      clean `?guard=…&network=testnet&tab=console`.
 *
 * The network parameter is validated against {@link NETWORK.name} on purpose:
 * this build is single-network (one passphrase, one RPC endpoint — see
 * `network.ts`), so a link claiming any other network is not "a different
 * state to restore" but a link that cannot mean anything here. It is rejected
 * the same way a malformed address is.
