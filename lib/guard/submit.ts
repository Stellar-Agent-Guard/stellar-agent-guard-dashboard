 * happy with it", and it takes `Keypair`s because in an agent runtime the key is
 * in the process. The dashboard must never hold a key — the admin signs in the
 * operator's browser — so this module implements the same
 * simulate → sign → enforce → submit sequence with a wallet standing in for the
 * keypair, and it hands the guard's own decision vocabulary back untouched.
 *
 * Nothing here is broadcast until the enforced simulation passes, so a refused
 * call costs nothing and leaves no trace on the ledger.
