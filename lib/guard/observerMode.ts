/**
 * Observer mode: what the console does with no wallet (issue #101).
 *
 * An auditor checking a client's spend caps, a teammate reviewing a policy, a
 * security analyst watching for a block — none of them should have to connect
 * an admin wallet to read the chain, and none of them should be able to sign
 * anything by accident. The distinction is already honoured in the code: every
 * read goes through `readGuardSnapshot(server, guard, source)`, where the
 * source account is only the *payer* of a read-only simulation, and every write
 * funnels through `signer()`, which throws without a wallet.
 *
 * What was missing is that the interface never *said* so. Write buttons went
 * inert with no explanation, which reads to a first-time visitor as "this tool
 * is broken" rather than "you are looking, not operating". So this module owns
 * one vocabulary — `observer`, `WRITE_DISABLED_HINT`, the per-control state —
 * and every write control in the console renders from it, so the wording cannot
 * drift between the policy form, the panic button and the deploy panel.
 *
 * Pure and React-free for the usual reason: the rules are the part worth
 * testing, and a test must be able to assert that a null wallet still produces
 * a readable source account without mounting a component.
