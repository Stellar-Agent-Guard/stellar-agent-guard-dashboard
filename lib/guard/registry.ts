/**
 * Adding a guard by address, with a live check before it is remembered.
 *
 * A `C…` string is not a guard. Typing an address into the selector and having
 * it stick would let the console claim it is watching an account that does not
 * exist, does not run the guard artifact, or is on a network this build cannot
 * read. The add flow therefore does two things in order, and persists nothing
 * until both pass:
 *
 *   1. Validate the StrKey (a Soroban `C…` contract address).
 *   2. Read the contract's own `status()` — the same read the panels use — and
 *      refuse the add when it traps or the transport fails.
 *
 * It signs nothing: the add flow never touches a wallet, so there is no
 * `sendTransaction` on this path at all. That is asserted by call-count in
 * `registryLive.test.ts`, not merely intended.
 *
 * The registry itself (the saved list, its network namespacing and the one-time
 * v1 migration) lives in `instance.ts`; this module is the verified front door.
