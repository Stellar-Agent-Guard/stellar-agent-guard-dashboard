/**
 * Telemetry: the guard's own events, from the two places they can exist.
 *
 * The part that is easy to get wrong, and which this module is shaped around: a
 * refused decision never reaches the ledger. The guard returns `Err`, which rolls
 * the event back, so a listener that only tails committed ledger events sees a
 * contract that appears to approve everything. The two sources are:
 *
 *   1. **ledger events** — allowed decisions, heartbeats, and the admin lifecycle
 *      events, tailed from `getEvents` with a cursor
 *      (`GuardTelemetryListener`, from the SDK).
 *   2. **simulation diagnostics** — refused decisions, which by construction have
 *      no transaction. The only place these arise in this dashboard is a write the
 *      operator attempted and the enforced simulation refused; the SDK's
 *      `guardEventsFromDiagnostics` decodes exactly those, and they are labelled
 *      `diagnostic` in the feed so they are never mistaken for settled history.
 *
 * "Real time" here means cursor-based polling of `getEvents`, because Soroban RPC
 * offers no push stream. The floor on latency is the ledger close interval, so
 * the feed reports the latest ledger it has seen rather than implying it is
 * instantaneous.
