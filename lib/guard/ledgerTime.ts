/**
 * Mapping wall-clock time to ledger sequences, for historical event queries.
 *
 * Soroban RPC's `getEvents` takes a ledger *sequence*, not a timestamp, so an
 * operator who wants "everything since Tuesday 14:00" first needs to know
 * which ledger that was. The chain does not index ledgers by time, so the
 * mapping is an estimate: ledgers close on average every ~5 seconds (the
 * protocol target enforced by Stellar's consensus timing), which gives
 *
 *     ledger ≈ reference + (t − t_reference) / AVERAGE_LEDGER_CLOSE_SECS
 *
 * anchored to a ledger whose close time is actually known (the latest ledger
 * the RPC reported, or any observed `ledgerClosedAt`). The estimate is
 * deliberately conservative in the useful direction: a starting ledger a few
 * *early* is corrected by the first page of results, while a starting ledger
 * too late silently misses events.
 *
 * The same arithmetic runs backwards for display: a ledger sequence maps to an
 * approximate wall-clock time so a query's range can be shown to the operator
 * in the terms they picked it in.
