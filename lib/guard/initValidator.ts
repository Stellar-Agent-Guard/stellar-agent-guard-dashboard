/**
 * Pre-flight validation of the parameters an operator is about to initialize a
 * guard with.
 *
 * A guard deployed with a flawed configuration is worse than one not deployed
 * at all: an admin and agent sharing one key defeats the separation the whole
 * product is built on, a zero dead-man grace means the switch can never trip,
 * and a rolling-window cap below the per-transaction cap silently disables the
 * window. None of those are caught by the contract at `initialize` time — they
 * only surface as a guard that behaves wrongly in production. This module turns
 * each into an explicit check the operator sees *before* the wallet is prompted.
 *
 * It is deliberately framework-free and DOM-free: the rules are the thing worth
 * testing, and the panel is a thin view over them.
