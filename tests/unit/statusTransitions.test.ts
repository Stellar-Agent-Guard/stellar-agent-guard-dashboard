/**
 * Poll transitions: what the chain did while nobody was looking.
 *
 * The property under test is restraint. A poll runs on a timer, forever, and
 * every announcement it makes costs the operator whatever they were reading —
 * so the announcer has to say nothing at all in the common case (a poll that
 * re-reads the same state) and everything at once in the rare one (a flag the
 * operator acts on flipped while the tab was in the background).
