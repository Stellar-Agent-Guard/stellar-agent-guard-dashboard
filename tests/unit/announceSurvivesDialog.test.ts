/**
 * The announcement outlives the dialog that caused it (issue #30).
 *
 * A confirmation dialog is torn down by the very interaction it exists to
 * collect — the operator confirms, and the thing they were reading disappears.
 * An announcement written into that dialog's own subtree is therefore an
 * announcement the operator never hears: the node is gone before the screen
 * reader gets to it, and what they are left with is focus jumping back to a
 * button with no context.
 *
 * So this asserts the ordering and the outliving separately, in the same shape
 * the app renders them: the announcer is a sibling of the panel, the freeze is
 * verified against an injected `status()` read, and afterwards the live region
 * is *the same node* it was before, carrying the message, while focus has
 * already returned to the trigger.
