/**
 * The inventory of what the console speaks about operator actions (issue #30).
 *
 * An announcement is only useful if it is the *right* one, and it is only
 * maintainable if there is a list to check. This file is that list, asserted
 * rather than described:
 *
 *   1. Every message a screen reader hears about an operation outcome is built
 *      in one module, so a translation pass has one file to walk and a reviewer
 *      can see the whole vocabulary in one screen.
 *   2. Every template is wired to a real call site. A template nobody calls is
 *      either a bug or dead weight, and both should fail here.
 *   3. A failure never speaks without its reason.
 *   4. There is exactly one place in the codebase that writes into a live
 *      region imperatively. Everything else announces through the queue, which
 *      is what supplies the deduplication, the ordering and the cap.
