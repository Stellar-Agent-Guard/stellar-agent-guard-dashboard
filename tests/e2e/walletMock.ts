/**
 * An in-page Freighter wallet mock, driven through the extension's own
 * `postMessage` bridge.
 *
 * The freighter-api bundle never touches `window.freighter`: it posts
 * `FREIGHTER_EXTERNAL_MSG_REQUEST` messages to the page and waits for a
 * `FREIGHTER_EXTERNAL_MSG_RESPONSE` with the matching `messagedId` (note the
 * extension's spelling). A content script is just a page-level listener, so a
 * mock that speaks the same protocol is indistinguishable from the real
 * extension — no bundler hooks, no module interception.
 *
 * The mock is injected with `page.addInitScript`, so it exists before any app
 * code runs, and it can switch networks at runtime, which is what the recovery
 * half of the scenario needs: the wallet refuses/lets the dashboard proceed
 * based on the passphrase it reports, exactly like the real thing.
