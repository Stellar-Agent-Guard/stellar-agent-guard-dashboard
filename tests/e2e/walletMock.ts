/**
 * A browser-context mock of the Freighter wallet extension.
 *
 * `@stellar/freighter-api` does not talk to the extension directly: it posts a
 * `FREIGHTER_EXTERNAL_MSG_REQUEST` message on `window` and awaits a matching
 * `FREIGHTER_EXTERNAL_MSG_RESPONSE` (note the API's own `messagedId` spelling
 * in the response). This module installs a listener — via `addInitScript`, so
 * it is in place before any application code runs — that answers those requests
 * with deterministic mock payloads, so the full sign flow (request access →
 * sign envelope) runs headlessly.
 *
 * Signing is simulated by echoing the envelope back unchanged: the dashboard
 * never verifies signatures locally (the network would), so an echo exercises
 * exactly the same code path a real approval would, without a secret key
 * anywhere in the test.
 *
 * Authorization is persisted in `localStorage` so the first visit shows the
 * disconnected state (the connect button is clicked by the test) while later
 * page loads auto-connect — the same behaviour an operator sees after having
 * granted the site access once.
 *
 * The address must match the admin account captured in
 * `tests/fixtures/rpc-capture.json`, because the mocked RPC serves that
 * account's ledger entry for sequence numbers.
