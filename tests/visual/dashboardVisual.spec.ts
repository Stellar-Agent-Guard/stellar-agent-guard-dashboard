/**
 * Visual regression baselines for the operator console.
 *
 * Two properties make these snapshots meaningful rather than decorative:
 *
 *   1. Every read the console performs is pinned to a failure, not to live chain
 *      data. The dashboard is a pure consumer of Soroban RPC, and testnet is a
 *      moving target: a balance, a rolling-window total and a dead-man countdown
 *      all change between runs, so a baseline taken against them would fail for
 *      reasons that have nothing to do with the layout. Blocking the RPC host also
 *      exercises the state this interface is most careful about — a read that did
 *      not succeed must render as a reported failure, never as a fabricated zero.
 *   2. The captured state is awaited explicitly (the panel that reports the failed
 *      read), so a screenshot can never catch a half-rendered loading frame. The
 *      dashboard's own copy is used as the wait condition, which means the test
 *      fails loudly if the failure is ever silently swallowed.
 *
 * The issue that specified this suite named four routes — `/`, `/configure`,
 * `/deploy` and `/panic`. The application has two: `/` composes the console
 * overview and the panic panel, and `/configure` composes guard deployment and
 * the policy form. The suite follows the application rather than inventing routes
 * to match the wording, so all four surfaces are covered by the two screens below.
